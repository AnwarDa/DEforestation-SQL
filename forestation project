Steps to Complete
 
 
1. Create a View called “forestation” by joining all three tables - forest_area, land_area and regions in the workspace.
 
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS forestation;

CREATE VIEW forestation
AS
  (SELECT forest_area.country_code,
          forest_area.country_name,
          forest_area.year,
          Round(forest_area.forest_area_sqkm :: numeric, 2)          AS
             forest_area_sqkm,
          Round(( land_area.total_area_sq_mi * 2.59 ) :: numeric, 2) AS
             land_area_sqkm,
          regions.region,
          regions.income_group,
          Round(( forest_area.forest_area_sqkm / (
                  land_area.total_area_sq_mi * 2.59 ) *
                  100 )
                :: numeric, 2)                                       AS
             perc_of_forest_area
   FROM   forest_area
          JOIN land_area
            ON forest_area.country_code = land_area.country_code
               AND forest_area.year = land_area.year
          JOIN regions
            ON regions.country_code = forest_area.country_code) 
 
 
2. The forest_area and land_area tables join on both country_code AND year.
3. The regions table joins these based on only country_code.
4. In the ‘forestation’ View, include the following:
 
All of the columns of the origin tables
A new column that provides the percent of the land area that is designated as forest.
Keep in mind that the column forest_area_sqkm in the forest_area table and the land_area_sqmi in the land_area table are in different units (square kilometers and square miles, respectively), so an adjustment will need to be made in the calculation you write (1 sq mi = 2.59 sq km).
